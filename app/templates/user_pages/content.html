      <div class="content-section">
        <p class="page-text">In one way or another, everything in our lives is connected. Whether it be the branches of a tree, the roads we drive on, the way our blood flows through our bodies, down to the very bonds hold together the atoms that make up our universe. These connections or networks, are often complex and are required to be analysed.</p>
        <p class="page-text"><span class="important-text">Graph Theory</span> is a way to represent these connections or networks. A graph (not to be mistaken with a graph of a function) consists of objects called <span class="important-text">nodes</span> or <span class="important-text">vertices</span> connected by lines that are called <span class="important-text">edges</span>. An easy example that we will focus on is a map of a town. A simple example is shown below</p>
        <img class="content-image" src="../static/images/basic.png" alt="Basic Graph">
        <p class="page-text">Where each letter represents the name of a house in the town and each line represents the roads to get to each house.</p>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-heading">Graphs</h1>
        <p class="page-text">The objects that make up a network are represented in the graph by <span class="important-text">nodes</span> or <span class="important-text">vertices</span> normally in the shape of circles. If a node is connected to another node, it is <span class="important-text">adjacent</span> to that node and we can also say that those two nodes are <span class="important-text">neighbours</span>.
          <img class="content-image" src="../static/images/basic.png" alt="Basic Graph">
        <p class="page-text">In the town example shown above, the houses in the town are represented by nodes and we can say that house “A” and house “B” are <span class="important-text">adjacent</span> to each other as they are connected by a line. Therefore they are also <span class="important-text">neighbours</span>, as is the case for every other pair of houses connected by a line.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Edges/Arcs</h1>
        <p class="page-text">A link between any two objects is called an <span class="important-text">edge</span> or <span class="important-text">arc</span>. In the town example, the road or streets connecting the houses are represented by edges shown by the lines in the graph. We tend to name the edges by the nodes that they connect, for example, the edge connecting node A and node B would be called edge AB. <span class="important-text">Note that edges can only ever connect a maximum of 2 nodes at once.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Paths</h1>
        <p class="page-text"><span class="important-text">Paths</span> are a sequence or order of nodes that we pass through to get to a certain node. For example, if I wanted to get to node C from node A, I would have to go from A to B to C, so the path would be A -> B -> C. If there is no possible path to a node or it is not connected to any other node, then the node is called <span class="important-text">isolated</span>. House “E” in the town is an example of an <span class="important-text">isolated node</span>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Connected Graphs</h1>
        <p class="page-text"><span class="important-text">Connected graphs</span> are graphs where all nodes are connected to at least one other node or the graph contains no isolated nodes. In order words, there is a at least one possible path between for one node to any other node. This means a connected graph has at least <span class="important-text">n-1 edges, where n represents the number of nodes in the graph</span>. Any graph that is not connected is called a <span class="important-text">disconnected graph</span>. Looking at the previous graph, we can see that it is an example of a disconnected graph as node E is an isolated node. The following graph is an example of a <span class="important-text">connected graph</span>:</p>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Weighted Graphs</h1>
        <p class="page-text">You can add <span class="important-text">weighting</span> to a graph by giving each edge a number or weight. In the town example, the length of each road is represented by the <span class="important-text">weights</span> of each edge. An example of a weighted graph is shown below:</p>
        <img class="content-image" src="../static/images/weighted.png" alt="Weighted Graph">
        <p class="page-text">You would say that edge AB has a weighting of 2 or in the context of the town example, you would say that to get from house A to house B, you need to travel 2km.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Shortest Path Problem</h1>
        <p class="page-text">The shortest path problem is a very common question in data structures that uses <span class="important-text">weighted graphs</span>. As the name implies, you have to find the path with the <span class="important-text">shortest distance</span> to a node, where <span class="important-text">distance</span> is simply the <span class="important-text">sum of all the weights</span> along the path. This is done by looking at all possible paths to a node and then adding all the weights along the way. In the graph shown above and again using the context of a town, if you want to travel from house A to house C, you would want to find the route with the least distance. In this case, you would go from house A to B then to C as it takes 5km compared to the other path through house D which is 6km</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Directed Graphs</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Until now, the graphs that we have looked at have only been <span class="important-text">undirected graphs</span> with have <span class="important-text">bi-directional edges</span>, meaning that you can go back and forth between nodes in a path. For example, looking at the previous undirected weighted graph, we wished to find a path from node A to C. We can say that path A > B > C and path A > D > C are both valid paths, but we can also say that  path A > B > A > D > C is valid as well. However, with directed graphs, there are now <span class="important-text">restrictions</span> to the <span class="important-text">direction</span> that we can travel along a graph. An example of a <span class="important-text">directed weighted</span> graph is shown below: </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="../static/images/directed.png" alt="Directed Graph">
        <p class="page-text">As represented by the arrows in the edges, this graph is now directed, and you can only <span class="important-text">travel in the same direction that the arrows are pointing to</span>. Meaning that you can no longer travel from C to B or from D to A. In the town example, the arrows or directions could represent <span class="important-text">one-way roads</span>. This affects the shortest path problem as paths must now be checked if they are valid before their distances can be calculated.</p>

        <h1 class="page-heading">Introduction to Trees</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Trees are commonly used variation of <span class="important-text">directed graphs</span> that are represented in the shape of an upside-down tree. This is demonstrated in the following images:</p>
        <div>
          <img class="inline-images" src="../static/images/basic_tree.png" alt="Basic Tree Graph">
          <img class="inline-images" src="../static/images/tree.png" alt="Tree Graph">
        </div>
        <p class="page-text">The left image is an example of a <span class="important-text">binary tree</span> which is a very common type of tree which we will learn about while the right image is used to help visualise the concept of a tree. Applying the tree visualisation to the left image, we can say that node A is the <span class="important-text">root node</span>, where the entire tree is created from. We can also say that node B and C are the <span class="important-text">branches</span> of the tree, also commonly called i<span class="important-text">internal nodes</span>. Finally we can say that nodes D,E,F and G are the <span class="important-text">leaves</span> of the tree or more commonly known as the <span class="important-text">external nodes</span>.</p>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Parent, Child and Sibling Nodes</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Some commonly used terms in trees are <span class="important-text">parent, child and sibling nodes</span>. These terms come from the concept of a family tree. Think of the tree graph on the left as your mums’ side of the family:</p>
        <img class="content-image" src="../static/images/basic_tree.png" alt="Basic Tree Graph">
        <ul>
          <li class="page-text">Node A would represent your grandma</li>
          <li class="page-text">Node B and C would represent your mum and aunty respectively</li>
          <li class="page-text">Node D and E would represent you and your brother or sister respectively</li>
          <li class="page-text">Node F and G would represent your cousins</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <p class="page-text">You would say that your grandma is the parent of your mum and aunty, hence A is the <span class="important-text">parent node</span> of B and C who in turn, are the <span class="important-text">child nodes</span> of A. You would also say that your mum and aunty are siblings and therefore node B and C are <span class="important-text">sibling nodes</span>.</p>
        <p class="page-text">Here is an example of the graph being applied to the family tree:</p>
        <img class="content-image" src="../static/images/family_tree.png" alt="Family Tree Graph">
        <p class="page-text">As shown from the family tree concept, any node that has a <span class="important-text">directed edge</span> pointing towards another node is the <span class="important-text">parent</span> of that node and that node is now a <span class="important-text">child</span> node. In trees, we also refer to <span class="important-text">nodes with no children</span> as the <span class="important-text">external nodes</span> of the tree or the <span class="important-text">leaves</span> of the tree, as there is nothing branching out from them. As such, any node that is <span class="important-text">not an external node is an internal node</span> as they exist inside the tree.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Root Nodes</h1>
        <p class="page-text">The <span class="important-text">root node</span> is simply the node at the top of the tree. There is only <span class="important-text">one</span> root node in any tree and there is only <span class="important-text">one possible path</span> from the root node to any other node in the tree. In the example graph, node A is the <span class="important-text">root node</span>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Depth</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Every node has a <span class="important-text">depth</span>, which is the <span class="important-text">number of edges from the node to the tree’s root node</span>. To calculate depth, we start at the <span class="important-text">root node</span> and go along a <span class="important-text">downward path</span> until we reach the target node, counting the <span class="important-text">number of edges</span> along the way. The path we have chosen should not matter and any path that reaches the target node can be used. For example, node 6 of the tree visualisation graph would have <span class="important-text">depth</span> of 3.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Level</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Every node has a <span class="important-text">level</span> which is normally calculated as <span class="important-text">depth + 1</span>. It can also be thought of as the <span class="important-text">generation</span> of the node when visualising a family tree. From the family tree example, we can say that your grandma is the <span class="important-text">first generation</span> in the family tree and therefore, node A has a <span class="important-text">level of 1</span> or exists at <span class="important-text">level 1</span> of the tree. Your mum and aunty would then be the <span class="important-text">second generation</span> of the tree and therefore node B and C have a <span class="important-text">level of 2</span> and so forth. For example, node 8 of the tree visualisation graph has a level of 2. <span class="important-text">Note that levels ALWAYS START FROM 1 and as such, the root node is the only node that has a level of 1</span>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Height</h1>
        <p class="page-text">The <span class="important-text">height</span> of a tree is the <span class="important-text">number of edges</span> that exist on the <span class="important-text">longest downward path</span> from the <span class="important-text">root node to a leaf node</span>. To find this, imagine we are starting from the <span class="important-text">ground up</span>, so we start at the <span class="important-text">lowest leaf</span> node and go along an <span class="important-text">upwards</span> path to the <span class="important-text">root</span>, counting the <span class="important-text">number of edges</span> along the way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-subheading">Binary trees</h1>
        <p class="page-text">A <span class="important-text">binary tree</span> is a tree graph where every parent node can have at <span class="important-text">MOST two children</span>. We normally refer to any children in a binary tree as either the <span class="important-text">left or right</span> child. Binary trees appear often in data structure algorithms and there are a variety of classifications such <span class="important-text">perfect binary trees</span> where each <span class="important-text">internal node</span> has exactly <span class="important-text">2 children</span> and all <span class="important-text">leaf nodes</span> are at the <span class="important-text">same level</span>. The family tree graph is an example of a perfect binary tree. A common question that involves binary trees is <span class="important-text">"what is the maximum number of nodes a binary tree can have if it has a height of h"</span>. Simply use the formula <span class="important-text">max =2<sup>h</sup> – 1</span> while the <span class="important-text">minimum</span> number of nodes can be calculated using <span class="important-text">h + 1</span> </p>

        <h1 class="page-heading">Introduction to Tree Traversal Algorithms</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Trees are often used in a variety of problems. For example, you are a great grandfather, and your memory is not that great these days. You hear you have a great granddaughter named Lily. You want to know if this is true and who her parents are.</p>
        <p class="page-text">Due to your poor memory, you only know the names of your own kids so you can only ask them the names of their kids. Unfortunately, poor memory runs in the family and each family member only knows the names of their siblings and their own children.</p>
        <p class="page-text">This is situation where you would need to search through your entire family tree to see if Lily really exists. But what would be the fastest or most efficient way of searching through this tree? This is where Tree Traversal Algorithms Come in.</p>
        <p class="page-text">A <span class="important-text">Tree Traversal Algorithm</span> is a way of searching through a tree ensuring that all nodes have been checked. We will be focusing on one type of algorithm called a <span class="important-text">Depth First Search</span>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <h1 class="page-heading">Introduction to Depth First Search</h1>
        <p class="page-text">Depth First Search involves searching all the way <span class="important-text">down</span> one path in a tree. If our goal is not achieved down that one path, you would <span class="important-text">backtrack up one level</span> and go down another path. In the family tree problem, you would ask your children if they have children, then ask that child the same thing until you find someone without a child, then you would know that you have reached the <span class="important-text">bottom</span> of your family tree (reached a leaf).</p>
        <p class="page-text">If that child is not Lily, you would then see if their parents have any other children and see if Lily is one of them. If not, you would then check the parent of that parent and check their children. This process is <span class="important-text">repeated</span> until you have checked your whole family tree.</p>
